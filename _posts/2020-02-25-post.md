#First change dir to desired dir
`cd DIR`

#Check if you are on desired dir
`pwd DIR`

#Check status of dir, if its git repositiory or not
`git status`

#If above step says, not a git repository move perform "git init" or move over to next steps
`git init`

#This is to add a particular file to staging area
`git add filename`

#This is to add all file in dir to staging area
`git add -a 
git add -all`
#After adding, check the status of the dir/repo
`git status`

#Now commit to the file/files with th e-m otion to add text about hwat changes have been made
`git commit -m "Adding script for fastqc and cutadapt"`

#Now remote in to a Github. First if you don't have the remote added, add the remote URL and name it. In this case I named it bioinformatics
`git remote add bioinformatics  https://github.com/BI-CTSICN/Bioinformatics-Core.git`

#Now push the changes made to bioinformatics master branch
`git push bioinformatics  master`
#This should ask for username and password for Github

#The following steps are for an error that occurred while pushing
`git fetch bioinformatics master:tmp
git rebase tmp
git push bioinformatics HEAD:master
git branch -D tmp`

#These command are in case for you to delete a particular branch.
`git push bioinformatics --delete COMBAT
git push bioinformatics --delete Bioinformatics_Pipeline`
